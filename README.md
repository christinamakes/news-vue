# How does the news feel?

You know how you feel about the news, but how does the news feel about the news? With this app users can enter a newsworthy topic and get back an overall positive or negative score on that topic. This app uses News API to fetch relevant articles and Dandelion API to parse the emotion of every article.

## Why did I make this?

This app was my 1 week adventure into learning Vue.js! I've been interested in learning Vue ever since I started building with React, and I heard all the cool kids on the block were using it ;) Vue was very refreshing to build in and came with a lot of handy features, like dead simple conditional rendering (v-if) and the all important v-for!
